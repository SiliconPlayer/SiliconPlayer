/**
 * Single observable holder for player drag/animation state.
 *
 * Bundling these flags into one [remember]-ed object keeps the Compose-generated
 * bytecode for `AppNavigation` under the 64KB JVM method limit while still letting
 * any composable observe individual fields reactively (each property is backed by
 * its own `mutableStateOf`/`mutableFloatStateOf`).
 *
 * The holder also exposes a derived [isAnyAnimating] getter that the playback poll
 * loop reads via a provider lambda. While any drag/animation is in progress the
 * poll loop suspends position/duration publishing so the UI thread can finish
 * the heavier composition / layout work without contention.
